# transit-destination-access

How much opportunity can people reach using public transit, and what factors change that access over time? This analysis measures destination access via public transit for several US metro areas over a decade. We also explore which kinds of land use and transportation policies have the greatest influence on destination access via transit using counterfactual scenarios.

Maybe I need a different project name though given the likely focus on GTFS and measuring intra-year sensitivity of access measures to service adjustments. Heck, depending on what kind of literature using GTFS feeds is out there, the central concept of the project may change from destination access to service adjustments.
